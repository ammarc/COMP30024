Comment file for Part A submission by Ammar Ahmed and Nam Nguyen.

Our package name (and AI name) is athena which has five class, namely
Piece, Horizontal, Obstacle, Board and Vertical. Both Vertical and Horizontal
inherit from the Piece abstract class. The Game class (which contains the main
method) is located outside the package in the src/ folder.

The program starts by getting the raw string input as the board and then removes
the space between the input and sets up the Board object. The pieces are then set
up by looping through the board and setting up an array list of the different pieces
on the board. Each pieces' directions are also set, so that it knows where it
is allowed to move. Since we are looping through a 2-D array and then setting
the attributes for each piece we find on the board, our time complexity is O(n^2).
Finally we loop through the array list of horizontal and vertical pieces in the
board to find the total number of legal move for each side. Since there are
2n - 2 pieces on the board, the complexity of this operation is O(n).
All in all, our program has a time complexity of O(n^2).
